# Course Notes  
TIL...  

## Events  
**Event Listners**
- for instance, *User Generated* events
- code that fires when specific event occurs, like clicks
- very familiar with these, so many events available  

**Life Cycle Events**
- commonly exposed by libraries or frameworks
- hook into specific events at specific times or conditions
- you know, like react hooks etc.
- *inversion* of control  

## Webhooks vs APIs
**An extension of APIs**
- sometimes referred to as 'reverse APIs'
- it calls your app, instead of the other way around
- what info is being sent to you & in what format?
- could be form data, json etc.
